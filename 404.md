# Thanks for stopping by 8-)

### If you're seeing this 404 page, it probably means I (Kimo) just made a couple changes to my personal portfolio website that you're looking for, and since it's hosted with GitHub Pages, the changes may take a few minutes to update, especially since I'm rerouting with a custom domain. 

#### I appreciate your patience if you do wait a bit to see the real site, and if you are `utterly flabbergasted` that a real developer doesn't have his own personal site running 60/60/24/7/52, please feel free to peruse his [GitHub Repos](https://github.com/eksilva).

#### If even that is too much, here's a nice octocat for your troubles.

#### Do come back, now, you hear?
